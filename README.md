This is the first python program I have built and is part of my project portfolio required in the Full-Stack Software Development Diploma I am currently undertaking.
The aim of this program is to scrape job information from the indeed.com website:
- The program should allow the user to input the type of job they are looking for and the location they would like that job to be in.
- The program should scrape the following information:
    1. The Job Title.
    2. The name of the Company that are hiring for the job.
    3. The Salary being offer for the job if available.
    4. A Summary giving a description of the role on offer.
- The first five job heading will be sent to terminal to show that the program run successfully.
- The program will send the the scraped data of the first five pages of the Indeed website and populate the jobs.csv file with it for analysis by the user.
